# insta-autologin-autodm
This is a program which I wrote to automate login and dm to friends from my command line and automates your chrome browser to do so and you can update this code with some sought of time scheduler and predefined messages using list and you can also do socket programming in order to host it in some other gui based server like ec2 aws server so that the chrome window will not popup in your screen.

Below are the modules and the dependencies for this program  and don't forget to run chrome webdriver once and keep it in the same directory in which your code is
```python
pip install selenium keyboard
